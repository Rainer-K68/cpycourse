# Python?

Not the animal, not (quite) the [Monty](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python).

## What is Python?
From the Python homepage (www.python.org):

["Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language."](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#what-is-python)

## A bit more in-depth information

### Hello world in Python
``` python
>>> print('Hello, World!')
Hello, World!
```

### Python is interpreted

### Python is interactive
Python has a so-called "**R**ead-**E**val-**P**rint-**L**oop"
([REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)).
That means that you can start the Python interpreter, type Python commands at
its prompt and immediately see the results:

```python
Python 3.8.2 (default, Feb 26 2020, 02:56:10)
>>> 1 + 1
2
```

### Python is object-oriented
   
According to https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objektorientierte_Programmierung: 

> Alan Kay, inventor of Smalltalk and the term „object oriented“, defined object-oriented in the context of Smalltalk as: 
> > "
> >  1. Everything is an object, 
> >  2. Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages (in terms of objects), 
> >  3. Objects have their own memory (in terms of objects), 
> >  4. Every object is an instance of a class (which must be an object), 
> >  5. The class holds the shared behavior for its instances (in the form of objects in a program list), 
> >  6. To eval a program list, control is passed to the first object and the remainder is treated as its message
> > "

### Python is multi-paradigm

 * supports multiple programming paradigms
   * object oriented programming
   * functional programming (but not pure)
   * imperative (+procedural) programming

#### Example: Object oriented programming in Python

#### Example: Functional programming in Python

#### Example: Imperative programming in Python

## Who invented it?
See [a brief history of Python](python-history.md).

## Do I need it?
See [why should I use Python](why-python.md).

## Where to get it

Python is Free/Libre Open Source Software (F(L)OSS) and can be obtained here: www.python.org

There is "Python the lanuage" and "Python the implementation:

Aside from the predominant reference implementation dubbed "CPython" several other implementations of Python the language exist, with varying degrees of version compatibility and adoption:
 * PyPy
 * Jython
 * IronPython
   * ...: Numba, Cython, ...
 
Furthermore, several Python distributions bundle Python, Python packages and external dependencies:
   * e.g. Anaconda
