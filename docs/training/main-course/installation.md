# Keeping a Python: Python installation

## Linux

In most Linux distributions Python comes preinstalled.

See https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html for further info.

## Windows

See https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html.

## MacOS

See https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html.

## Online Pythons

Instead of installing Python there are some cool options for using Python
as a cloud-based service, from your browser:

 - Repl.it: https://repl.it/
 - Python Anywhere: https://www.pythonanywhere.com
 - Trinket: https://trinket.io
 - Python Fiddle: http://pythonfiddle.com

These solutions allow for varying degrees of "not needing a local Python 
installation, at all". At the very least, they are great for trying out simple
things, from basically anywhere.

And then, there's the incredible [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org). 
Jupyter notebooks bundle documentation, code and data and can be used for
amazing stuff. Starting out with Python, Jupyter now supports a wide range of
languages and can also be used as a cloud-based service from here:
