## Starting the Python interpreter

For an interactive session simply type `python` in a console/shell of your computer

    $ python
    Python 3.6.5 (default, Jun 28 2018, 16:00:48) 
    [GCC 4.8.5] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 



type in your 1.st Python statement and press the <enter>-key

    >>> print ("Hello World")
    Hello World
    >>>



## Running a Python program

Running a Python Programm can be done by providing code as a command-string (i.e. a sequence of python-statements separated by semicolons) on commandline using the following command:

    $ python3 -c "print('Hello World')"
    Hello World
    $

This is sufficient for short checks.

But typically the code is placed into files named <module-name>.py (in our case helloworld.py)
  and the code can be executed running the following command:

    $ python3 helloworld.py
    Hello World
    $
